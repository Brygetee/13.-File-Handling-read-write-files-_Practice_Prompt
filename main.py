13. File Handling (read/write files)
What you should know: Save and load data from text files.
 Practice Prompt: Write a program that saves your current sewing project ideas to a
 file called projects.txt, then reads it back to display.

* "a" creates the file if it doesn't exist and appends if the file does exist
* use with open(...) so you donâ€™t have to manually close() every time
*use "if os.path.exists("projects.txt") instead of a try and except to avoid catching unnecessary exceptions
